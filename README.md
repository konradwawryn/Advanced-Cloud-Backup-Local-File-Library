# Advanced-Cloud-Backup-Local-File-Library
    This project provides tools to catalog and manage files before sending them to cloud storage. Even if the original files are later deleted from your local device, a full record of what was backed up is kept. This way, you always know what exists in the cloud â€” without relying on the cloud provider to tell you.
